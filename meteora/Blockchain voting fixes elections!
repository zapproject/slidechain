Blockchain voting as a solution: Why and how?
The philosophy as the basis for the solution
Everything else is only babble

There can be many iterations of a blockchain voting system
as envisioned in the named patents above.

While the system uses our patented blockchain called slidechain
(see patent 9,608,829 to understand slidechain)
But it is not about the system
It is never about the system
It is always about the solution.

A real solution has segregated chains
Each chain being a fork from an original or parent blockchain

For the sake of security and latency performance
Each function should have its own chain

The key to a blockchain voting solution
Is to have one chain be the master "credentials" chain
which governs who may participate in any election event

Because the biggest fraud event opportunity
Is not in the election itself
it is always in allowing people to circumvent the credential gate
The gate determines whether you can vote or not
