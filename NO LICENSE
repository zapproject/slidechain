MATERIAL SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES PATENTS as stipulated below.
Access to the content is strictly limited to viewing and reading only. No form of license, 
including but not limited to copying, modifying, distributing, or using for any purpose, will be granted without a 
formal, signed, and delivered license agreement from Blocktech, LLC. This policy is explicitly linked to the ownership 
of United States Patents 9,608,829 and 9,836,908 (each, the "Patent" and collectively, the "Patents") 
by Blocktech, LLC, a company legally established under the jurisdiction 
of the State of Colorado, United States of America. 
Any use beyond reading and viewing is prohibited unless formally 
authorized by Blocktech, LLC through a legally binding agreement.

Additional Clarification:
There is no formal license agreement between Blocktech LLC and Zap aka Synapse Foundation 
for the use of the patented slidechain system and method. 
Although the parties have from time to time had discussions regarding the subject, 
there can be no assurance any formal license agreement will be executed, agreed upon, 
reduced to writing or otherwise reached, 
or that Zap aka Synapse Foundation will ever be contractually permitted 
to develop, use or incorporate the patented technologies. 

THERE IS NO LICENSE FOR ZAP TO USE THE PATENTS.
THAT IS BECAUSE THE SYNAPSE FOUNDATION (on behalf of ZAP) HAS NOT COME TO TERMS 
WITH TERMS OF A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE LICENSE AGREEMENT.
