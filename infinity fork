The patented configurable blockchain systems described here are designed to give users maximum flexibility. 
There is a product and service in existence called "enterprise blockchain" or "EB"
Some EB systems claim to provide flexibility, or customizability.
What some other EB systems seem to do is give "more than one" choice to customers.
These EB systems give customers choices, but EB chooses the choices.
Those EB customers only get the choices the EB system wants.
Those EB customers do not get to make their own choices, design their own chain.
Those EB customers do not have customizable Blockchain-as-a-service.
Those EB customers are just getting a cheap buffet of selections they may not want. 
Blockchain-as-a-service can do better.
Customers deserve better.
